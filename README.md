# BlockIO â€“ Low-Level Disk Access for C# on Windows

**BlockIO** is a C# library that fills a critical gap in the Windows ecosystem: it enables direct, low-level access to physical disks and partitions â€” without relying on filesystem APIs or unsafe native code. Inspired by Linux tools like `dd`, `partx`, and `blkid`, BlockIO gives .NET developers structured, introspectable control over block devices.

## ðŸ§© Purpose

Windows lacks a clean, managed way to access raw disk sectors, GPT/MBR headers, and partition boundaries. BlockIO solves this by offering:

- Safe, stream-based access to physical disks and partitions
- GPT and MBR parsing without filesystem dependency
- Partition introspection via GUID, name, or index
- Device abstraction for RAM, files, USB, and virtual disks
- Compression-ready containers for snapshots and transfer

## ðŸ”§ Core Components

### ðŸ“¦ Devices

- `AbstractDevice` â€“ base class for all device types
- `FileDevice`, `RamDevice`, `UsbDevice`, `VirtualDiskDevice`
- `CreateDeviceStream()` for raw access
- `GetPartitionById`, `GetPartitionByGuid`, `GetPartitionByName`

### ðŸ§± Partitions

- `AbstractPartition` â€“ holds LBA range, GUID, name
- `CreateStream()` â€“ returns a bounded stream over the partition
- No filesystem logic â€” structure only

### ðŸ”„ Streams

- `PartitionStream`, `DeviceStream`
- Access variants:
  - `ReadOnlyPartitionStream`
  - `WritePartitionStream`
  - `RWPartitionStream`
  - Same for device-level streams
- All implement `IBlockStream` with:
  ```csharp
  Stream CloneAsReadOnly();
  Stream CloneAsWriteOnly();
  Stream CloneAsReadWrite();

### Utilities

HeaderUtility â€“ GPT/MBR header parsing and validation

BlockRange, StreamTraits, DeviceDescriptor â€“ for analysis and tooling
